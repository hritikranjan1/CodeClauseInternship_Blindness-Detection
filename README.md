![Blindness Detection]

This repository contains code for detecting eyes in an image using Haar cascades in OpenCV.

## Description

The `eye_detection.py` script utilizes a pre-trained Haar cascade classifier for eye detection. It loads an image, converts it to grayscale, and detects eyes using the Haar cascade classifier. If eyes are detected, it prints "Eyes detected!"; otherwise, it prints "No eyes detected." The script also displays the image with rectangles around the detected eyes.
